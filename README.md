#Twitter Hate Speech Detector

## Overview

In today's digital age, social media platforms like Twitter have become breeding grounds for hate speech and cyberbullying. This project aims to address this issue by developing a hate speech detector specifically tailored for Twitter. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to automatically identify and flag tweets containing hateful or abusive language. Five different models - Random Forest, Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes - will be explored and compared to determine the most effective approach for hate speech detection on Twitter.

## When to Use Hate Speech Detection?
Hate speech detection can be employed in various scenarios including:
#### Moderating social media platforms to remove hateful content.
#### Identifying and addressing online harassment and cyberbullying.
#### Monitoring online communities to ensure a safe environment for users.
#### Analyzing trends in hate speech for research and policy-making purposes.


## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a curated collection of data from various social media platforms including Twitter, Kaggle, Wikipedia Talk pages, and YouTube. Each instance in the dataset consists of a tweet along with corresponding annotations indicating whether it contains hate speech or not. The data encompasses different types of cyberbullying such as hate speech, aggression, insults, and toxicity. To ensure robustness and generalization, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.


## Models used:

### 1)Random Forest
### 2)Nearest Neighbour
### 3)Decision Tree
### 4)Logistic Regression
### 5)Naive Bayes
